    <h1>
        This is a homework where I've practiced with different types of the selectors.
        I used an element selector to center the text and add Blue bgcolor.
    </h1>

    <div>
        <p>
            I made this Grey page background using the element selector on "body".
        </p>

        <p>
            I tried to change font using selector which cause effect on all the paragraphs where the parent is
            "body>div"
            tags.
        </p>

        <p>
            I put all inputs into the div and used ".class" selector to change background color to Aquamarine and
            play with overall style. I understand it has no practical sense, but I made it just as an excercise for myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            On next step I used selector which added Green color and shadows to <span id="color-uppercase">inputs with "type=text"</span> which you can see bellow.
            But input with attribute "name=input-bright" is Lightsalmon color and include previous style settings
            because I attached "name" attribute to selector and placed it bellow.
        </p>

        <div class="input-grid">
            <input type="text">
            <input type="text">
            <input type="text" name="input-bright">
            <input type="text">
        </div>

        <p>
            You've probably noticed colored uppercase in previous paragraph. It's because I used an "id=color-uppercase"
            selector on it
        </p>

        <p>
            There are a few pictures from Interstellar movie. I used an element selector type again to adjust width and
            heigth of three pictures.
            You can watch it directly on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDVtMYqUAyw"
                target="_blank">clicking here.</a>
            (On the link I applied selector which choose every "a" element whose "href" begins with "https")
        </p>

        <p>Finally on the second picture I used attribute selector which selects all ellements with "title=water-space"
        </p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/interstellar.jpg" width="200px" alt="Try again later">
        <img src="img/interstellar (1).jpg" title="water-space" width="200px" alt="Try again later">
        <img src="img/QTAU3ALF23MVKIKR7FWQO4CP7E.jpg" width="200px" alt="Try again later">
