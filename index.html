    <h1>
        This is a homework where I've practiced with different types of the selectors.
        I used tag selector to center the text and add Blue bgcolor. (1 POINT)
    </h1>

    <div>
        <p>
            I made this Grey page background using the tag selector on "body" (1 POINT).
        </p>

        <p>
            I changed font style and color using selector which cause effect on all paragraphs where the parents are
            "body" and "div" tags (3 POINTS).
        </p>

        <p>
            I put all inputs into the div and used ".class" selector to change background color to Aquamarine and
            make grid (10 POINTS). I understand it has no practical sense, but I made it just as an excercise for myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next I used tag and attribute selectors which added Green color and shadows to
            inputs with "type=text" attributes which you can see bellow (11 POINTS).
            But third input has Lightsalmon color because I used "name=input-bright" and applied tag and attribute selectors and placed it bellow (11 POINTS).
        </p>

        <p>
            In this <span id="color-uppercase">colored uppercase</span> I used an "id=color-uppercase"
            selector on it (100 POINTS).
        </p>

        <div class="input-grid">
            <input type="text">
            <input type="text">
            <input type="text" name="input-bright">
            <input type="text">
        </div>

        <p>
            You can watch YouTube video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDVtMYqUAyw" target="_blank">clicking here.</a>
            I applied tag and attribute selectors to the link, which choose every "a" tag whose "href" attribute begins with
            "https" (11 POINTS).
        </p>

        <p>
            There are a few pictures from Interstellar movie. I used tag selector to adjust width and
            heigth of all images (1 POINT).
            Then I put "inline style" to first picture (1000 POINTS).
            Finally on the second picture I used attribute selector which selects all ellements containing
            "title=water-space" (10 POINTS).
        </p>

        <div>
            <img src="img/interstellar.jpg" width="200" alt="Try again later" style="border-color: indigo;border-style: double;border-width: 7px;">
            <img src="img/interstellar1.jpg" title="water-space" width="200" alt="Try again later">
            <img src="img/QTAU3ALF23MVKIKR7FWQO4CP7E.jpg" width="200" alt="Try again later">
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
