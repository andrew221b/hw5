    <h1>This is a homework where I've practiced with different types of the selectors. I used an element selector on the title to center the text</h1>
    
    <p>
        I made this page's background using the same element selector type as in "h1" tag.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I tried to change font using selector which cause effect on all the paragraphs where the parent is "body" tag
    </p>
    
    <p>
        On this step I used selector which added green color and shadows to <span id="color-uppercase">inputs with "type=text"</span> bellow. 
        Input with "name=input-bright" will be lightsalmon color and include previous style settings because I attached "name" attribute to selector and place it bellow. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I put all the inputs into the div and used ".class" selector to change background color to aquamarine. and play with overall style. I understand that it has no practical sense, but I made it just as an excercise.
    </p>

    <div class="input-grid">
     <input type="text">
     <input type="text">
     <input type="text" name="input-bright">
     <input type="text">
    </div>

    <p>
        You've probably noticed colored uppercase in previous paragraph. It's because I used an "id" selector on it
    </p>
