    <h1>
        This is a homework where I've practiced with different types of the selectors.
        I used an element selector to center the text and add Blue bgcolor.
    </h1>

    <div>
        <p>
            I made this Grey page background using the element selector on "body".
        </p>

        <p>
            I changed font style and color using selector which cause effect on all paragraphs where the parent is
            "body>div"
            tags.
        </p>

        <p>
            I put all inputs into the div and used ".class" selector to change background color to Aquamarine and
            make grid. I understand it has no practical sense, but I made it just as an excercise for
            myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            On next step I used tag and attribute selectors which added Green color and shadows to 
            <span id="color-uppercase">inputs with "type=text"</span> attributes which you can see bellow.
            But input with attribute "name=input-bright" is Lightsalmon color
            because I attached "name=input-bright" attribute to selector and placed it bellow.

        </p>

        <p>
            Also you noticed colored uppercase in previous paragraph. It's because I used an "id=color-uppercase"
            selector on it
        </p>

        <div class="input-grid">
            <input type="text">
            <input type="text">
            <input type="text" name="input-bright">
            <input type="text">
        </div>

        <p>
            There are a few pictures from Interstellar movie. I used an element selector to images to adjust width and
            heigth.
            You can watch YouTube video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDVtMYqUAyw" target="_blank">clicking here.</a>
            I applied to the link attribute selector which choose every "a" tag whose "href" attribute begins with "https"
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally on the second picture I used attribute selector which selects all ellements containing "title=water-space"
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="img/interstellar.jpg" width="200" alt="Try again later">
        <img src="img/interstellar1.jpg" title="water-space" width="200" alt="Try again later">
        <img src="img/QTAU3ALF23MVKIKR7FWQO4CP7E.jpg" width="200" alt="Try again later">
    </div>
</body>
