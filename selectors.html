    <h1>This is a homework where I've practiced with different types of the selectors.</h1>
    
    <p>
        For instance, I made this page background using "class" selector type inside "body element"
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's "paragraph" tag and I used selector which was applied for all <span id="p-span">"paragraph"</span>  ellements.
    </p>

    <p>
        But as you can see, second word "paragraph" has different color because I used an "id" selector
    </p>
